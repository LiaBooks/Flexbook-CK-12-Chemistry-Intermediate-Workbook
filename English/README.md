15. Read the following passage and answer the questions:
16. The line between pure chemistry and applied chemistry is not always distinct. For example, in the early 1960s, chemists at DuPont were searching for a new lightweight and strong fiber that could be used in tires. Chemist Stephanie Kwolek discovered, somewhat by accident, that a certain solution she had made displayed unique characteristics that were unlike those of other previously developed substances. The rapid expansion in the field of polymer chemistry that has occurred over the past 50 years was partially due to the results of her research. Polymers are very, very large molecules comprised of smaller subunits that are repeated over and over again in extremely long chains. The polymer that was discovered at DuPont was eventually given the name Kevlar. It is used not only in tires but also in bulletproof body armor because of its high strength and light weight. Polymer chemistry continues to be an active and vibrant field of chemistry, as both a pure and an applied discipline.

The term theory is one that is often misunderstood by people in the general population who are unfamiliar with the scientific method. Though a scientist may state that a theory cannot be proven correct, he or she is certainly not saying that it is in doubt. A scientific theory has generally been confirmed over and over and over again, although small details within a theory may be adjusted from time to time as new discoveries are made. In a later chapter, you will learn about atomic theory and how it has changed over the last few centuries. While the existence of atoms has not been in question for some time, new details about how the atom functions have resulted in many updates and alterations of the essential theory.

**Lesson Objective: Identify physical changes to matter.**

23. Read the following passage and answer the questions.
24. As an ice cube melts and it acquires the ability to flow, its shape changes. However, its composition does not change. Melting is an example of a physical change. A physical change is a change to a sample of matter in which some properties of the material change, but the identity of the matter does not. Physical changes can further be classified as reversible or irreversible. The melted ice cube may be refrozen, so melting is a reversible physical change. Physical changes that involve a change of state are all reversible. Other changes of state include vaporization (liquid to gas), freezing (liquid to solid), and condensation (gas to liquid). Dissolving is also a reversible physical change. When salt is dissolved in water, the salt is said to have entered the aqueous state. Boiling off the water will cause the salt to reform in its solid state. An example of an irreversible physical change would be grinding a piece of wood into sawdust. Such a change is irreversible because the sawdust cannot be reconstituted into the same piece of wood that it was before. Cutting the grass or pulverizing a rock would be other irreversible physical changes.
    1.  Would boiling water be reversible if the water vapor goes off into the atmosphere?
    2.  Is burning gasoline in a car engine a physical change?
25. One of the following is not a physical change
    1.  burning wood
    2.  chopping wood up
    3.  making furniture from wood
    4.  stacking wood
26. All of the following except one are reversible physical changes
    1.  boiling water
    2.  making ice cubes
    3.  bagging corn kernels
    4.  making popcorn
27. True or False: A physical change involves a change in the identity of the sample.
28. True or False: Making earrings from a gold nugget is an irreversible physical change.
29. True or False: Bending aluminum sheets is an irreversible physical change.
30. You cook an egg on the stove and heat your coffee in the microwave. Which process is a physical change? Explain your answer.

15. True or False: Hot water is used to cool a distillation column.
16. Read the passage below and answer the following questions
17. Sand does not dissolve in water. In order to separate sand from water, the mixture can be poured through a filter. The tiny holes of a filter, called pores, allow the water to pass through while trapping the sand grains behind. Filtration is a technique that separates solids from liquids in a heterogeneous mixture. Distillation is a method of separating a mixture based on differences in boiling points. A small-scale laboratory distillation apparatus is used to separate substances based on differences in their boiling points. For example, the impure liquid could be a mixture of alcohol and water. As the mixture is heated, the alcohol begins to boil before the water does because of its lower boiling point. The alcohol vapors rise up in the flask and into the long cylindrical tube, which is called a condenser. Cold water is continually pumped into the outside of the condenser, which causes the alcohol vapors to condense back into the liquid state. The purified alcohol then drips into the flask labeled “distilled liquid,” while the water is left behind in the original flask. Distillation is commonly used to purify water by separating it from the various dissolved minerals that are found in natural water sources.

25. A container holds 24.3 L of a solution containing 0.5 moles/L sodium chloride. How many moles of sodium chloride are there in the solution?
26. The SI units of density are kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m_3_), because the kg and the m are the SI units for mass and length, respectively. Unfortunately, this unit is awkwardly large for everyday usage in the laboratory. Most solids and liquids have densities that are conveniently expressed in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm_3_). Since a cubic centimeter is equal to a milliliter, density units can also be expressed as g/mL. Gases are much less dense than solids and liquids, so their densities are often reported in g/L. Densities of some common substances at 20°C are listed below (Table 1.4). Since most materials expand as temperature increases, the density of a substance is temperature-dependent and usually decreases as temperature increases.
27. Why would the density of a substance decrease as the temperature increases?
28. A student wants to convert cm/sec to miles/hour. He sets up the following conversions:
29. $$
    \left ( \frac{cm}{sec} \right ) \left ( \frac{60 \ seconds}{hour} \right )\left ( \frac{m}{100 \ cm} \right )\left ( \frac{km}{100 \ m} \right )\left ( \frac{mile}{1.6 \ km} \right ) = \left ( \frac{miles}{hour} \right )
    $$
    
30. Will these conversion factors give him the correct answer? Explain your reasoning.

31. A group is a vertical \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of the periodic table.

34. English chemist John Newlands (1838-1898) arranged the elements in increasing order of atomic mass and noticed that every eighth element exhibited similar properties. He called this relationship the _Law of Octaves_. Unfortunately, some elements were missing, and the law did not seem to hold for elements that were heavier than calcium. Newlands’ work was largely ignored and even ridiculed by the scientific community in his day. It was not until years later that another more extensive effort to construct a periodic table would gain much greater acceptance, and the pioneering work of John Newlands would be appreciated.
35. Why was Newland ridiculed by his scientific colleagues?
36. Why is the organization of the periodic table by physical properties not very useful?

33. Another anomaly can be found between Groups 15 and 16. Atoms of Group 16 (O, S, etc.) often have lower ionization energies than atoms of Group 15 (N, P, etc.). This can be explained in terms of Hund’s rule. In a nitrogen atom, there are three unpaired electrons in the 2p sublevel. In an oxygen atom, there are four electrons in the 2p sublevel, so one orbital must contain a pair of electrons. One electron from this pair will be removed first during the ionization of an oxygen atom. Since electrons repel each other, it is slightly easier to remove an electron from a doubly occupied orbital than to remove an unpaired electron. Consequently, removing a paired electron from oxygen requires slightly less energy than removing an unpaired electron from the nitrogen atom.
34. Why is it easier to remove an electron from a paired orbital?
35. What problems could exist with the current way of determining atomic radii?

As an example, consider the bond that occurs between an atom of potassium and an atom of fluorine. Using the table, the difference in electronegativity is $4.0-0.8=3.2$. Because the difference in electronegativity is relatively large, the bond between the two atoms is primarily ionic. Since the fluorine atom has a much larger attraction for electrons than the potassium atom does, the valence electron from the potassium atom is considered to have completely transferred to the fluorine atom. The figure below shows how the difference in electronegativity relates to the ionic or covalent character of a chemical bond.
32. Is there a clear difference between an ionic bond and a covalent bond?
33. Offer one reason why a knowledge of bond polarity might be useful in predicting chemical reactions.

30. In a triple bond, how are the sets of unhybridized $p$ orbitals oriented with relation to one another?

Elements in the third period and beyond are capable of expanding their octet to form molecules with either trigonal bipyramidal or octahedral electron domain geometries. In order to accomplish this, the previously unoccupied orbitals in the $d$ sublevel of the central atom are involved in the hybridization process. For phosphorus pentachloride (PCl<sub>5</sub>), the electron domain and molecular geometries are trigonal bipyramidal. The electron promotion is from the $3s$ orbital to an empty $3d$ orbital.

![0](media/11.png)

The hybridization then occurs with a single $s$ orbital, three $p$ orbitals, and a single $d$ orbital. The set of five hybrid orbitals are called $sp^3d$ hybrids.

&nbsp;![0](media/12.png)

The overlap of the five hybrid $sp^3d$ orbitals with the $3p$ orbital of each chlorine atom results in the five covalent bonds of PCl<sub>5</sub>. Other molecular geometries derived from trigonal bipyramidal electron domain geometry (seesaw, T-shaped, linear) also display the same hybridization. Is the promotion of an $s$ orbital electron to a $d$ orbital a violation of the Aufbau principle.

31. Would you expect a bond formed by overlapping $p$ orbitals to be more reactive than a sigma bond on the same carbon? Explain your answer.

26. How does this information affect our definition of a catalyst?

27. If a reaction mechanism is proposed that is based on an intermediate that has not been detected, is this a useful mechanism? Explain your answer.

30. Suggest one way we could incorporate information about changing amounts of solids during an equilibrium reaction.

Equilibrium represents a balance between the reactants and the products of a chemical reaction. Changes to the conditions of the system can disturb that equilibrium. When this occurs, the system reacts in such a way as to restore the equilibrium. However, the position of equilibrium will be changed following the disturbance. In other words, the response of the system involves a change in the amounts of the reactants and products. Some will increase and some will decrease until equilibrium is reestablished.

23. In the Haber-Bosch process for the synthesis of ammonia, the reaction takes place in a closed system. If additional nitrogen is added, that produces an increase in the concentration of material, which is expected to favor the forward reaction to form ammonia. How will this increase in nitrogen gas affect the pressure of the system and the equilibrium position?
24. In the reaction $CaCO_3(s) \rightleftarrows CaO(s) + O_2(g)$, if the amount of $O_2$ is increased, does that decrease the decomposition of calcium carbonate or decrease the formation of calcium oxide?

29. Is the above reaction spontaneous at 298 K?

30. Assume that the $\Delta H$ and $\Delta S$ values are still valid at higher temperatures, will the reaction still be spontaneous at 775 K?

When $\Delta H$ is negative and $\Delta S$ is positive, the sign of $\Delta G$ will always be negative, and the reaction will be spontaneous at all temperatures. This corresponds to both driving forces being in favor of product formation. When $\Delta H$ is positive and $\Delta S$ is negative, the sign of $\Delta G$ will always be positive, and the reaction can never be spontaneous. This corresponds to both driving forces working against product formation.

31. What is required for a non-spontaneous reaction to occur?

32. A combustion reaction is considered to be spontaneous, but firewood does not burst into flame until an external source of heat is provided. Why is burning wood considered an spontaneous reaction?

13. The relationships between Gibbs fee energy and the equilibrium constant is written
    1.  $\Delta G^\circ=RT \ln(K_{eq})$
    2.  $\Delta G^\circ=-RT \ln(K_{eq})$

20. Calculate the $K_{eq}$ for the reaction at 298 K

21. For the reaction $N_2(g) + 3 H_2(g) \rightleftarrows 2 NH_3(g)$, the $\Delta G$ at $298 \ K = -32.96 \ kJ$, calculate the $K_{eq}$.

When this reaction is performed, the amount of products can be detected by monitoring the pressure of the CO<sub>2</sub> gas that is produced. Above about 700°C, measurable amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> are produced. The pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> at equilibrium gradually increases with increasing temperature. Above 835°C, the pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> at equilibrium begins to exceed 1 atm, the standard-state pressure. This is an indication that the products of the reaction are now favored above that temperature.

22. Why is this calculation helpful in the production of quicklime?

23. What other information might be useful in designing a system for production of quicklime from calcium carbonate?

| $K_{eq}$ | $\ln(K_{eq})$ | $\Delta G^\circ$ | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| \>1 | positive | negative | Products are favored at equilibrium. |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | Reactants and products are equally favored. |
| <1  | negative | positive | Reactants are favored at equilibrium. |

The **self-ionization** _of water is the process in which water ionizes to hydronium ions and hydroxide ions_. As with other aqueous acid-base reactions, the process is often simplified to show the ionization of just one water molecule into a hydrogen ion and a hydroxide ion.

$H_2O(l) \rightleftharpoons H^+(aq)+OH^-(aq)$

Either equation is adequate, though the first is more accurate, since hydrogen ions in aqueous solution will always be attached to water molecules. Further discussion of acids and acid ionizations in this book will primarily show hydrogen ions in aqueous solution as H_+_, but keep in mind that this is just a commonly used abbreviation for the more accurate hydronium structure. 32. Is it incorrect to talk about \[H_+_\] instead of \[H<sub>3</sub>O_+_\]?

33. Why would the equilibrium constant for water omit the water itself as a factor in the equilibrium?

| household bleach | 10_\-13_ M | 13  |
| orange juice | 10_\-4_ M | 4   |
| soap | 10_\-11_ M | 11  |

32. In 1896, Henri Becquerel was studying the effect of certain uranium salts on photographic film plates. He believed that the salts had an effect on the film only when they had been exposed to sunlight. He accidentally found that uranium salts that had not been exposed to sunlight still had an effect on the photographic plates. The Curies, associates of Becquerel at the time, showed that the uranium was emitting a type of ray that interacted with the film.

30. Benzene is the parent compound of a large family of organic molecules known as aromatic compounds. Although benzene was discovered in 1826, it was many years before its structure was fully understood. In 1895, German chemist August Kekulé (1829-1896) realized that the benzene molecule could be best represented by a six-membered carbon ring with one hydrogen atom attached to each of the carbon atoms. Unlike cyclohexane, benzene is unsaturated; each carbon atom participates in one double bond.
    
    Why would it be difficult to deduce the structure of benzene?
    

_Critical Writing_

31. There are many tales in the scientific literature about how Kekulé developed his ideas about the benzene ring structure by having a dream in which a snake swallowed its own tail. How would this dream have helped Kekulé come up with his proposal?
